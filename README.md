# *Scales*

Scales is a prototype for a day-by-day weight loss tracker, built with a ASP.NET backend API and a Angular v17 frontend. It uses Entity Framework Core and Identity to manage user accounts and account data such as weight entries, user settings, logins etc.

# How to run locally
Prerequisites:
- A copy of Visual Studio with .NET support installed (to open the backend)
- Visual Studio Code (to open the frontend)

Steps:
1. Make sure you have angular set up on your system (at least v17, You can get it from [here](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)).
2. Using the CLI in your code editor of choice (or command prompt), cd into the root folder of the project, and then run ``npm i`` to install the required packages for the project to run.
3. Once installed, run ``ng serve`` to compile the project. Once complete, the project will be viewable on ``localhost:4200``.
